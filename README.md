MOMO
----

This is the Web Application I built during my Master's course. It allows anyone to organise and playback his/her music using a Server/Client Application. The Media Server is built using Java and launches a Web Server. By browsing to the Manager and Player Web Apps, anyone can configure the music that should be used on the server side. The music will then be scanned and updated using various web services. Additionally the Manager app allows users to update their musics' metadata manually as well as using Google to quickly set covers for albums.
