MOMO
----

This is the Web Application I built during my Master's course. It allows anyone to organise and playback his/her music using a Server/Client Application. The Media Server is built using Java and launches a Web Server. By browsing to the Manager and Player Web Apps, anyone can configure the music that should be used on the server side. The music will then be scanned and updated using various web services. Additionally the Manager app allows users to update their musics' metadata manually as well as using Google to quickly set covers for albums.

Saggezza Desk Booking
---------------------

This is a web application written using Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Bootstrap and Knockout. The application allows administrators to add desks to multiple rooms. After this employees are able to book the desk they prefer by logging in to the application and selecting the desk they prefer, during the period they prefer. 

I wrote this application as part of an Internship at Saggezza in London, for a working demonstration of the Desk Booking application navigate to:

and login using your google account. Move your mouse to the left of the page to open up the menu.
